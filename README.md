### Introduction

Our group will analyze and visualize aspects of the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset) provided by Kaggle. It contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by 150+ employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) during its investigation of Enron's collapse. This is the May 7, 2015 Version of dataset published at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/.

This repo and this [Flask app frontend](https://apps-summer22.ischool.berkeley.edu/enron-vizards/) serve as our submission for the MIDS W209 Summer 2022 Final Project. Additional project instructions can be found on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@berkeleyvis/final-project?collection=@berkeleyvis/course-home).

### Leading Questions

1. Who was heavily involved in the scandal?
2. Could the emails have told us that something was going on before investigations started?
3. Do the email contents indicate who knew of the fraud and who didn’t?

### Environment Setup

Use [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to create a virtual environment and load in the required packages.

```bash
conda create -n <your_environment_name> python=3.8
conda activate <your_environment_name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
